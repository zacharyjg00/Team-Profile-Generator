# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
This is a Team Profile Generator. This is an app that is run using node.js where the user is prompted for information about their team and an html webpage is generated using the information that is given. The webpage contains cards that display the information about all members in the team. The user is first prompted for information about the manager and then has the option to either add an engineer, an intern, or complete their team.
